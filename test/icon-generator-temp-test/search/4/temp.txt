lets start from ui:
*ui called when builds in c
	ui contains:
		object GlistStore (id viewlist)			
		object GtkSingleSelection(id selection_model)
		object GtkWindow (id window)
		*in c only window is called

		viewlist:
		have property item-type - FileBrowserView
			object FileBrowserView(1)
			object FileBrowserView(2)
			object FileBrowserView(3)
			FileBrowserView is structure from c 
			 defined and setted functions like a set/get property
			 also finalize - clearing, initizalization of class
			 get_display_name, get_content_type, get_size, get_icon
			 view_activated - something with info, guess activated when selected
			 *contain property factory with object GtkBuilderListItemFactory
			  and with bytes with embeded xml with:
			  	GtkImage - binding name gicon and function filebrowser_get_icon
			  	GtkLabel - bindingname label and function filebrowser_get_display_name
			  	both have lookup name item with(GtkListItem)
			  	*some differents with properties buth same
			  	
		selection_model:
		have property model and object GtkDirectoryList(id dirlist) with property attributes(name,icon,size...etc)
		
		window:
		have the child titlebar with
			GtkHeaderBar
			GtkListView
			GtkScrolledWindow
			*for the app i think important only last
			**lets start from the last
		
from the last:
lets add GtkScrolledWindow 
in .ui GtkScrolledWindow have a model selection_model it is mean we must add something with this name and what is it selection model
selection model it is object in ui and it is contain properties and in .c with binded path (in our case path in /lib)
lets add GtkSingleSelection in .ui and binding path in .c
next in .ui GtkScrolledWindow is factory and orientation both with FileBrowserView it is mean we must understand what are each both and add FileBrowserView in .c
orientation - it is something about orientation of view and property in FileBrowserView in .c
factory - also property and it is GTK_TYPE_LIST_ITEM_FACTORY 
lets try not touch it and just add FileBrowserView in .c
in general it is what i not understood in (b3)
*compilator saying  Error building template class 'IconGeneratorTempTestSearchWindow' for an instance of type 'IconGeneratorTempTestSearchWindow': .:0:0 Invalid type 'FileBrowserView'
maybe we can just add viewlist objects
**failure for me, i just tried copy example but this example about a new type in builder and as i sayed before i am not understood global concept of factory and lists/view
lets continue (c) and write ourself(i mean with simple gtk widgets)
